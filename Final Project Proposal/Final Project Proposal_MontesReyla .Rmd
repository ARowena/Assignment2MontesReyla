# 1 Introduction


Migration, the movement of individuals is quite literally, shaping and changing the face of societies. International migration and emigration is part of a transitional shift is hardly a new phenomenon, but more recently it has gained momentum amongst academic scholars and policy makers. People have moved from country to country for centuries, be it for social, political or economic reasons. More than 200 individuals now live outside of their home country and few countries are unaffected by international migration (Martin, 2014). International emigration is part of a transnational shift that is currently reshaping societies and politics around the globe. 

Migration is one of the three main determinants of a country's population development. The other two - the birth and death rate - are generally believed to be easier to forecast (Castles, Haas and Miller, 2014). However, factors that have classically been seen as drivers for migration between two countries such as [a] conditions in the sending country driving out inhabitants, including political troubles, persecution, conflict and other "push factors"", [b] conditions in the receiving country attracting migrants, such as higher wages, better know as "pull factors", and [c] factors which facilitate or authorize the migration process itself, such as the receiving country's immigration politics. 

More recently, there been new trends that have also enhanced the population flows. Martin (2014) highlights four trends that have increased and continue to improve migration flows.  First, the demand of multinational countries to strengthen global mobility has improved the influx in _economic integration_. Secondly, the change in _geo-political and security_ has enhanced international cooperation, with autonomous countries seeking legitimate forms of transnational mobility, in a world posed with any security threats. A third trend that has portend the need for enhanced economic cooperation is the _increasing transnationalism_, whereas individual migrants hare able to maintain strong relationships and connections in two or more countries has fostered a growing acceptance of multiple-nationality. Additionally, a fourth trend that increases migration flows can be attributed to some extent to new _challenged_, such as  _climate change_ that push individuals to migrate to a new location. 

One driving factor increasingly put forward in recent years is the use of technology. According to Hiller and Franz (2004), computer mediated communication has created new possibilities for migrants to maintain strong linkages and ties with their home nations. Improved technology has changed the landscape for communicating, and gathering knowledge and information. These revolutions that have transformed society is making travel and telecommunications cheaper and easier than ever. Technology has enhanced the aspects of interaction and it is transforming the way individuals communicate. 

# 2 Research Question 

Has the increase use of technology affected the flow of emigration?

# 3 State of the Art

When examining this topic further, it is essential to examine the already present literature and theories involved. As migration has been an ongoing phenomenon for many centuries, examining the theroies will provide a strong foundation for subsequent discussion and provide a framework for the entire analysis. 

According to @Castles2014 there are some determinants that "push" and "pull" individuals out of certain regions or areas. The first "push" and "pull" model was developed by Passaris in 1989, and he can be classified as a 
_Functionalist theorist_. There here are economic, environmental, and demographic characteristics that influence an individual's choice to stay or leave a particular geographic region. There are a large number of "push" factors, among those include - population growth and density, security issues, economic opportunities, and political factors. On the other hand, the characteristics of the receiving countries may also influence people's decision to pack up and leave. These characteristics are commonly known in the literature as, "Pull" factors, much like their counterparts have a strong influence on attracting a moderate flow of people. Among them include, the demand for labour, the availability of land, economic and employment opportunities, and favourable immigration policies. 

Nevertheless, the "push" and "pull" model only accounts for causal relationships between variables and does not take into account for certain simultaneous determinate. However, this analysis will not focus on residual determinants.

Another theory common among the literature is the _Neo-classical theory_, which affirms that the market allocates labour depending on demand and supply. In most cases, the demand of employment will automatically provide a supply of persons willing to do the labour in order for the market to reach equilibrium. The determinants of the individual decision will be based on the wage differentials among two geographical areas. To illustrate, a person will be more willing to move to another for labour and employment if the offering wage is higher and more competitive than in their home market. 




# 4 Method
## 4.1 Data Selection
In order to examine the flows of migration, we intend to to use data on trends in _International Migrant Stock_ produced by the United Nations. The data contains information from 232 countries and provides the number of migrants by destination and country of origin for four periods of time; 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2013. Moreover, to account for technology diffusion we will use _World Bank indicators_ on the number of Internet users and the number of cellular mobile subscriptions for each country. 

##4.2 Emperical Strategy

To examine the hypothesized effect technology, cross country panel data analysis will be conducted.
